# Sombrero

Sombrero is my A-Level Computer Science project (AQA), focused on simulating the three-dimensional N-Body Problem. Basic documentation can be found at [sombrero.readme.io](https://sombrero.readme.io), and reference for the Simulation class can be found in the Reference section of that site.

> Upon recent inspection of these setup instructions, it appears they may not work... Whoops. I'll make sure to prioritize fixing that! I'm also aiming to add some interesting feature updates in the near future too, so stay tuned. :)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get a copy of the project running on your local machine, for development and testing purposes (I haven't written the `make install` command yet).

### Prerequisites
In order to produce the output `.mp4` files, you will need to have `avconv` installed.

```
sudo apt-get install libav-tools
```

If you don't have `cmake` installed already, you will also need to install it.

```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

You will also need a copy of `pngwriter` installed on your machine.

```
sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev libfreetype6-dev
git clone https://github.com/pngwriter/pngwriter.git
cd pngwriter
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/
sudo make install
```

It is also important to note that you will require **g++-4.9** in order to compile Sombrero (as regex is used). You can check your installed version of g++ using the following command. If it says that you have 4.9.x installed, you should be good to go!

```
g++ --version
```

If you don't already have g++-4.9 installed, you can install it with the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++-4.9
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9 50
```

### Installing from source
To download a copy of the repository, you will need to type the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/tvarnish/sombrero.git
cd sombrero
make setup
```

## Usage
Once the software has been installed, the program can be run from within the `sombrero` directory using the following command:

```
./sombrero
```

If you wish to time the simulation, you can use `time` on the program, like so:

```
time ./sombrero
```

You can change what the script does by editing the file: `src/testing.cpp`. Once you have changed this file, call `make` in the main directory (`sombrero`), and then run the software as described above. Full scripting / usage notes can be found at [sombrero.readme.io](https://sombrero.readme.io/docs)

## Initialisation files
Initialisation files are comprised of a number of lines, each describing one 'body' in the simulation. Each line must be writen as follows (replacing the text in the example below with a numerical value, e.g. 5 or 4.0e10, etc.):

```
x position,y position,z position,mass,radius,x velocity,y velocity,z velocity
```

So, for example, if we were to have the Sun at the centre of the simulation (currently stationary), we could write:

```
0,0,0,1.989e30,6.955e8,0,0,0
```

If you wish to write a comment in the file, you can use // to indicate that anything after the double forward slash on that line is a comment. For example:

```
0,0,0,1.989e30,6.955e8,0,0,0 // An example of a comment
// Another example of a comment
```

You may also place any whitespace (except a newline!) between each of the parameters and the commas, if you wish.

## Output
The output files generated by the software (in the format `simulationname_output.csv`) follow the same structure as the initialisation files supplied to the software, as described above.

Sombrero will also produce an `.mp4` file of the simulation (still images from the simulation can be found the `images/` directory).
